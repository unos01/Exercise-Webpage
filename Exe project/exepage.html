            <p>Push exercises for the upper and lower body are the ones when you push something from yourself. For example, when you push all your body off the ground with push-ups or push your upper body with glutes and hamstrings in squats. These exercises
                are focused on large anterior muscle groups of the chest, shoulders, and quadriceps.</p><br> Do push-pull workouts help you lose weight? According to science1, resistance training (including weight lifting) engages large muscle groups
            and is as efficient for weight loss as aerobic exercises. It can help you improve your body composition and lose fat in the long term by increasing your metabolism.<br><br> Pull exercises are those when you pull something towards yourself.
            For example, when you pull yourself closer to the bar in chin-ups or pull a dumbbell to yourself in bicep curls. Pull exercises help you work on your posterior muscles of the back, rear delts, glutes, and hamstrings.
