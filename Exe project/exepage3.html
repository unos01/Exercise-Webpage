            <p>First, the biceps is a two-headed muscle with two separate regions referred to as the long head and the short head.<br><br> Then we have the brachialis muscle, which is technically a separate muscle from the biceps. However, it greatly influences
                the visual size of your biceps, and is the key to getting wider biceps.<br><br> There are three main functions of the biceps: elbow supination, elbow flexion and shoulder flexion.<br><br> The first core function of the biceps is elbow
                supination. The biceps supinate the elbow thanks to the large tendon that runs from the bottom of your biceps around to the radius of the elbow.
